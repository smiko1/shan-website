            <h2>Thinking About Bulking?</h2>
            <p> 
                Ahh! That's great! So many girls are afraid to bulk. I was afraid to bulk. I still am afraid to bulk!! But I do it for the gainz, 
                and that's just what you have to constantly think of whenever you get down about your extra flab ;)
                <br>
                When I first started bulking, I was so curiuous as to what other girls did as far as calories, exercise, amount of weight they were trying to gain, etc. 
                I actually had kind of a hard time finding it. I know these factors are different with every person based on weight, height, age, metabolism, etc. but I just wanted 
                to know a good starting point. Since I had some trouble finding that kind of information, I decided to have a whole page dedicated to it :) so read away!!
                <br>
                First thing's first. I'm 5'8" and was 135 lbs when I first started bulking.
                <br>
                Second. A lot of you aren't sure what to do as far as calories go. I wasn't either, so I just experimented by doing a little pyramid thing. I don't really know what to 
                call it.. anyways, let me explain - 
                so before I started bulking, I was at maintenance at 1800 calories (seems so low thinking about it now!). My first month of bulking was October of 2018 and I 
                only increased my calories by 300 (so I increased to 2200). In November, I increased again to 2400. In December I increased AGAIN to 2600. In January I went back 
                down to 2400, and in February I went to 2200. And then it was time for cutting! Of course, I did have my days where I ate WAY more (ahem, Christmas and the whole 
                week after) and days where I would eat a little less, but for the most part I stuck to what I set for myself. And it worked great for me. I was able to finally (after 
                3 months) get to 150 lbs. 
                <br>
                Third. Exercise. A lot of people totally quit cardio during the bulking period. I don't. And here's why. By increasing my calories, I'm gaining lean muscle 
                mass. But with muscle mass comes a little bit of fat. Or maybe more than a little bit - it depends on how much you're eating. Yes, too much cardio can inhibit 
                muscle growth. But at lower intensities and shorter periods of time, it will help to minimize body fat. The key words here are LOW intensity. You don't wanna be burnin' 
                too many calories! While bulking, the types of cardio I did included: walking on a treadmill at an incline for <= 30 minutes, stairmaster on a low-medium tempo for 
                <= 30 minutes, and jogging at speed 6.0 mph or less on a 2% (or higher) incline for 20-30 minutes. All very low intensity stuff. That way it keeps my heart healthy 
                and my increase in body fat as low as possible.
                <br>
                And finally, we talk about weight goals when bulking! To make it pretty simple, my goal was to gain 15 lbs. I went from 135 lbs to 150 lbs in the span of ~5 months. 
                I'm not gonna lie, I felt pretty damn flabby near the end of it all. I'm so used to wearing crop tops to the gym and man, it just wasn't workin' for me anymore. Add to 
                it the fact that I was pale as HECK. But guys... I thought about the future gainz and decided that it was so worth the sacrifice. I thought of summer, and my vacations, 
                and knew that in the end it would be 100% worth it.
                <br>
                If you have any questions about bulking, whether it be my past experiences or your FUTURE experiences (;)), shoot me an email! I'm always here for you!
                <br>
                So I guess to conclude.. if you've been debating on whether you should bulk or not, YES. There's your answer. JUST DO IT!!! You'll thank me later!!
