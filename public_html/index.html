            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <div class="left">
                <p> Hey y'all! I'm Shannon and I'm currently 21 years old. I started my fitness journey about 
                    5 years ago when I became obsessed with cardio. Yup, I was one of those "cardio bunnies". Trust me, cardio is amazing and 
                    it has SO many benefits. But regardless, I still didn't have the body I wanted. I was lean and I didn't need to lose any weight - 
                    in fact, I almost looked too skinny. I was 5'9" and 122 lbs (my all-time low) when I decided to get into lifting. That was 
                    about 2 years ago. So here I am, 5'9" and all 150 lbs of me!
                    <br> As of February 2019, I finished my first successful bulk. I'm now in the process of my first official 'cut', and I plan 
                    to put all of my personal experiences with it on the bulking and cutting pages that you can 
                    find on the navigation tab above. So if you're thinking about going through a bulking or cutting phase for 
                    the first time, go to those pages I just mentioned because I wrote them specifically for you!!
