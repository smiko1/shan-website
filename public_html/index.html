            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> Hi yall! My name is Shannon and I'm currently 21 years old. I started my fitness journey about 
                5 years ago when I became obsessed with cardio. Yup, I was one of THOSE fitness people. Not 
                hating on those people, though! Trust me, cardio is amazing and it has SO many benefits. But 
                regardless, I still didn't have the body I wanted. I was lean and I didn't need to lose any weight, 
                but I looked almost too skinny. I was 5'9" and 122 lbs when I decided to get into lifting. That was 
                about 2 years ago. So here I am, 5'9" and all 150 lbs of me!
